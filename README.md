Lighweight system monitoring

# Introduction
Honestly, there is nothing groundbreaking here. I just want to build a
monitoring system which provides a RESTful API. No web UI, GUIs, client apps,
none of the fancy stuff.

# Stuff I am trying to achieve
- Test Driven Development
- Inbuilt server for testing
- Blog interesting stuff learned along the way
- Implmenting plugin interface
- Be free of third party libraries as much as possible
